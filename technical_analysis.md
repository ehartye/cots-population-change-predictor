# Technical Analysis: COTS Population Change Predictors and Model Performance

## Overview
This document presents a comprehensive analysis of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) population dynamics based on ReefCheck survey data. Our research combines statistical analysis of historical patterns with machine learning predictions to understand and forecast COTS population changes.

## 1. Statistical Analysis of Precursor Patterns

### 1.1 Methodology
- Analysis focused on survey measurements with ≥2 valid segments
- Effect sizes calculated to quantify the strength of relationships
- Statistical significance assessed using p-values (α = 0.05)
- Control comparisons used to establish baseline differences

- >60cm size class:
  * Pre-increase: Effect size 1.20 (p=0.0104), 756.4% higher than control
  * Pre-decrease: Effect size 0.97 (p=0.0057), 613.6% higher than control

**Giant Clams (40-50cm)**
- Pre-increase: Effect size 1.26 (p=0.0001), 900% higher than control
- Pre-decrease: Effect size 1.53 (p<0.0001), 1100% higher than control

#### 1.2.2 Unique Increase Predictors
1. Giant Clams >50cm
   - Effect size: 0.90 (p=0.0038)
   - 589.4% higher than control
   - Present in 14.3% of initial surveys

2. Bleaching Indicators
   - Population percentage:
     * Effect size: 0.55 (p=0.0146)
     * 119.8% higher than control
     * Present in 85.7% of surveys
   - Colony percentage:
     * Effect size: 0.54 (p=0.0154)
     * 52% higher than control
     * Present in 85.7% of surveys

3. Coral Damage
   - Effect size: 0.54 (p=0.0145)
   - 47.4% higher than control
   - Present in 85.7% of surveys

#### 1.2.3 Unique Decrease Predictors
1. Humphead Wrasse
   - Effect size: 1.04 (p=0.0018)
   - 640.4% higher than control
   - Present in 14.3% of surveys

2. Parrotfish
   - Effect size: 0.96 (p=0.0032)
   - 209.2% higher than control
   - Present in 64.3% of surveys

3. Tripneustes
   - Effect size: 0.78 (p=0.0064)
   - 631.4% higher than control
   - Present in 7.1% of surveys

## 2. Predictive Model Analysis

### 2.1 Model Performance
- Overall accuracy: 77.1% on known events
- Strong performance on both increase and decrease predictions
- High confidence predictions (>80%) particularly common for COTS increases

### 2.2 Feature Importance
1. Total Giant Clam Count (20.97%)
2. Coral Damage Other (13.35%)
3. Bleaching Population % (11.89%)
4. Bleaching Colony % (10.68%)
5. Parrotfish Presence (5.93%)
6. Giant Clam 40-50cm (5.76%)
7. Parrotfish Count (5.50%)
8. Coral Damage Presence (4.57%)
9. Grouper 40-50cm (3.90%)
10. Bleaching Presence (3.72%)

### 2.3 Ecological Implications

1. **Trophic Cascade Effects**
   - Strong correlation between predator presence (Groupers, Humphead Wrasse) and COTS population changes
   - Different size classes of Groupers showing varying effect sizes suggests complex predator-prey relationships

2. **Ecosystem Health Indicators**
   - Giant clam abundance as top predictor suggests potential shared environmental preferences or ecosystem health indication
   - Bleaching and coral damage patterns indicate possible stress-related COTS population changes

3. **Population Control Factors**
   - Presence of certain species (Parrotfish, Tripneustes) correlates with COTS decreases
   - Multiple size classes of predators showing significance suggests importance of maintaining complete predator populations

### 2.4 Management Implications

1. **Monitoring Priorities**
   - Focus on giant clam populations as key indicators
   - Track coral health metrics (bleaching, damage)
   - Monitor predator populations across size classes

2. **Early Warning System**
   - Model shows strong predictive power for COTS increases
   - High confidence predictions (>80%) provide reliable early warnings
   - Multiple indicator types allow for robust monitoring system

3. **Conservation Strategies**
   - Protect predator populations, especially larger size classes
   - Maintain giant clam populations as ecosystem health indicators
   - Monitor and manage coral health to potentially prevent COTS outbreaks
