Hi Eric,

Thank you for your data request. I have attached our Australia data from 2019-2023. Please note that 2023 is still being imported, so that year is only partially complete.

 

Additional notes:

The 100m transect line is divided into four 20m segments (S1 – S4) in which data is collected. For a diagram, further information about our protocol and datasheets, please visit: https://www.reefcheck.org/tropical-program/tropical-monitoring-instruction/ 

 

All data for a site is linked by a unique site ID (column A). Blanks are different than zeroes and mean that data was not recorded.

 

Site notes: We redesigned the Site Description sheet in 2003 and again in 2010, adding some fields and deleting others. These old fields have “archived field” in their column name. Any other blanks mean that the data wasn't recorded or the value was unknown. Comments recorded during the substrate and belt surveys are also found here.

 

Substrate notes: The “total” field is the number of times in a transect segment that a substrate type was identified. In a full 100m survey, the transect line is divided up into four 20m segments with 5m gaps in between. In each segment, 40 points of data are collected so there are 160 points of data for a full 100m survey. Sometimes teams are only able to survey half the transect or data from one segment is missing. These exceptions are noted in the “errors” field of the table or the substrate comments field. In 2003, the “FS” code for Fleshy Seaweed was replaced with “NIA” for Nutrient Indicator Algae. This was only a change in name; the definition remained the same. However, every survey export will show both the FS and NIA data fields.

 

To calculate the percentage substrate type for a segment, you will need to divide the counts by 40. Then these percentages can be averaged to get the mean % per segment.

 

HC/B and HC/D (bleached hard coral and diseased hard coral) are listed in the file, but are not currently being used (all data is zero). Bleaching and disease identified during the survey is recorded in the Belt data file instead.

 

Belt notes: The organism belt table represents abundance data for our indicator organisms. There are also two trash categories and three coral damage categories. Those 5 fields are measured using a 0-3 (none to high) scale instead of being counts. There is also coral bleaching and coral disease data- percentage per segment.

 

In regards to how we record bleaching:

 

If bleaching is present, two estimates are made. First, teams estimate the percentage of all corals on the transect that are bleached. Second they estimate the mean percent of each individual colony that is bleached. For example, the estimate might be 30 out of 100 corals (30%) along the transect are bleached but of the colonies bleached, the mean level of bleaching per colony is 80%.


If some or all the data is used, we ask that you please include an acknowledgement to Reef Check Foundation. We would also appreciate a copy of the final publication, if possible. Please see the attached data use terms and conditions for details.
